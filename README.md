# Twitter Sentiment Analysis System

In the current era where social media has become a primary vehicle for public opinion, efficiently and accurately analyzing sentiment tendencies within massive volumes of textual data has emerged as a critical challenge across multiple domains, including public opinion monitoring, market research, and public policy feedback. Twitter, as one of the world's most influential information dissemination platforms, presents a highly challenging yet valuable research scenario for sentiment analysis due to its short-text nature. To address this, we propose a Twitter sentiment analysis system driven by the synergistic integration of PySpark and deep learning technologies. This system is designed to combine large-scale data processing capabilities with advanced model expressiveness, enabling an end-to-end workflow from data collection to decision support.

## Key Features
- **Social Media's Role**: A dominant medium for public discourse
- **Analytical Challenge**: High-volume, high-velocity sentiment analysis
- **Twitter's Uniqueness**: Short-text format intensifies complexity and research value
- **Proposed Solution**:
  - **PySpark**: Distributed processing of large datasets
  - **Deep Learning**: Nuanced sentiment detection
  - **End-to-End Design**: From data ingestion to actionable insights

## Technical Specifications

### Core Dependencies
